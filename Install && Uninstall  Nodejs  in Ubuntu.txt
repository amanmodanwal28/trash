                                    ** Nodejs Install Process **

1. Update your package list: Open a terminal and run the following command:

 # sudo apt update

2. Install required dependencies: Run this command to ensure you have the necessary software to fetch the Node.js packages:

 # sudo apt install curl software-properties-common

3. Add NodeSource repository: Node.js provides an official PPA (Personal Package Archive) to install the latest versions. To add the repository for the latest Node.js (LTS or Current), run:

** For 22 version :   

 # curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -


3.1. Download the nvm installation script:

 # curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

3.2. Activate nvm: After installation, you need to activate nvm. You can do this by either restarting your terminal or running the following command:

 # source ~/.bashrc

4. Install Node.js: After adding the NodeSource repository, you can install Node.js by running:

 # sudo apt install nodejs


 5.  ***Verify installation: Once the installation is complete, verify it by checking the Node.js and npm versions:

#  node -v
#  npm -v
#  npx -v
#  nvm -v


6. ***Install the OpenSSH server:

 # sudo apt install openssh-server -y
7. *** Check the SSH service status: After installation, SSH should start automatically.    Verify its status with:

 # sudo systemctl status ssh



                                        **  Nodejs Uninstall Process  ** 


1. Remove Node.js via apt (if installed through apt earlier):
If Node.js was installed through apt earlier, remove it using:

   # sudo apt-get remove --purge nodejs npm

    # sudo apt-get autoremove

    # sudo apt-get autoclean


2. Delete Node.js-related folders (if they still exist):
Remove any remaining Node.js directories:

 # sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules
 # sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/node
 # sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/npm


3. Remove NVM directory

 # rm -rf ~/.nvm

4. Remove NVM references from shell configuration files

 # sed -i '/NVM_DIR/d' ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile 2>/dev/null

 # sed -i '/nvm.sh/d' ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile 2>/dev/null

 # sed -i '/bash_completion/d' ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile 2>/dev/null

5. Reload the shell to apply changes
 # exec $SHELL



6. Verify removal:
After performing the above steps, verify that Node.js and npm are no longer available:

 # node -v
 # npm -v
 # nvm -v
 # npx -v


All commands should now give an error indicating that Node.js, npm,npx and nvm are not found.
