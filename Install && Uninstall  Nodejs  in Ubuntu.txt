                                    ** Nodejs Install Process **

1. Update your package list: Open a terminal and run the following command:

 # sudo apt update

2. Install required dependencies: Run this command to ensure you have the necessary software to fetch the Node.js packages:

 # sudo apt install curl software-properties-common

3. Add NodeSource repository: Node.js provides an official PPA (Personal Package Archive) to install the latest versions. To add the repository for the latest Node.js (LTS or Current), run:

  **For LTS version (recommended for most users):

 # curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -

 ** For Current version (latest features, but may not be as stable):

 # curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | sudo -E bash -


4. Install Node.js: After adding the NodeSource repository, you can install Node.js by running:

 # sudo apt install nodejs


 5.  ***Verify installation: Once the installation is complete, verify it by checking the Node.js and npm versions:

#  node -v
#  npm -v




                                   2    ** Nodejs Install Process **

Step 1: Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
To install nvm, run the following commands:

 1. Download the nvm installation script:

 # curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

 2. Activate nvm: After installation, you need to activate nvm. You can do this by either restarting your terminal or running the following command:

 # source ~/.bashrc

 3. Verify nvm installation: To verify that nvm has been installed successfully, run:

 # nvm -v

Step 2: Install the latest version of Node.js with nvm
Now that nvm is installed, you can use it to install the latest Node.js version.

 1. Install the latest stable version of Node.js:
 
 # nvm install --lts

 2. Verify the installation: Check the installed Node.js and npm versions:

 # node -v
 # npm -v


Step 3: Switch between Node.js versions (optional)
If you want to switch between different versions of Node.js, you can use nvm to install other versions and set one as the default:

** To install a specific version:

# nvm install <version>

**To switch between versions:

nvm use <version>






                                        **  Nodejs Uninstall Process  ** 


1. Remove Node.js Snap package:
First, try to remove the Snap package of Node.js using the following command:

    # sudo snap remove node

2. Check for any remaining Snap packages:
If Node.js is still present, list all installed Snap packages:

    # snap list

Look for Node.js in the list, and if it exists, remove it again using:

 # sudo snap remove node
   

3. Remove Node.js via apt (if installed through apt earlier):
If Node.js was installed through apt earlier, remove it using:

   # sudo apt-get remove --purge nodejs npm

    # sudo apt-get autoremove

    # sudo apt-get autoclean


4. Delete Node.js-related folders (if they still exist):
Remove any remaining Node.js directories:

 # sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules
 # sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/node
 # sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/npm

5. Verify removal:
After performing the above steps, verify that Node.js and npm are no longer available:

 # node -v
 # npm -v


Both commands should now give an error indicating that Node.js and npm are not found.
